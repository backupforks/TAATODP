* Dynamic Programming cannot be passively teached, but _actively_ learned by *considerable practice* with solving problmems _on one's own_.

* Why dynamic programming is more *art* than _science_ we do not know. But *common sense*, not mathematical manipulation, is what it takes to be successful in a course in dynamic programming.

* Goals:
    * Primary: identify *state* and *stage* variables, and define and characterize the *optimal value function*.
    * Secondary: use DP analytically to establish the _structure_ of the optimal solution and the necessary conditions.
    * Final: special techniques.

* Chapters
    * 1-8: deterministic
    * 9-14: stochastic
    * 15: learning related
    * When used in undergraduate classes: 1-4, 6(1-4), 9-11, 13, 15(1-5).
