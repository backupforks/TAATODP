Equipment Replacement
=====================

The Simplest Model
------------------

* In `N` time periods, we originally have a machine with age `y`. `c(i)` is the cost of operating a machine with age `i`; `p` is price of a new machine; `t(i)` is trade-in value for machine with age `i`; `s(i)` is the salvage value of machine with age `i` at the end of `N` time periods.

* The problem is to minimize the total cost during the next `N` time periods.

Dynamic-Programming Formulation
-------------------------------

* The optimal value function is trivial and left as exercises.

Shortest-Path Representation of the Problem
-------------------------------------------

* Use _age of machine_ as y-axis and _time_ as x-axis, we can represent the problem as a shortest-path problem.

Regeneration Polnt Approach
---------------------------

* **TODO**

More Complex Equipment-Replacement Models
-----------------------------------------

* Added the third choice between "keep" and "replace": "overhaul".

* And other variants in exercises.
