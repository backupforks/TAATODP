Problems with Linear Dynamics and Quadratic Criteria
====================================================

Introduction
------------

* Problems with a struture different from, but analogous to, the common structure of all linear-programming problems.

* Mathematical analysis leads to routine solution of problems with dozens of state variables.

* Newton-Raphson procedure to find the minimum/maximum of a function.

A Linear Dynamics, Quadratic Criterion Model
--------------------------------------------

* *Linear dynamic system*:
    - `x(i)` state at stage `i`
    - `y(i)` the decision
    - `x(i+1)` = `g(i)x(i) + h(i)y(i)`

* *Quadratic Creterion*
    - `J` = `Î£[a(i)x^2(i)+c(i)y^2(i)] + lx^2(N)`
    - Minimize `J`

A Particular Problem
